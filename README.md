# try-various-classifiers-on-digits-dataset
 appling various classifiers on digits (sklearn dataset) to compare the score between the ML classification algorithms

by applying svm,NB,random forest, and decision tree classification algorithms the algo that has the highst score is svm

svm  scored  98.
random forest  scored 97%
Logistic Regression  scored 96%
NB  scored 84%
decision tree  scored 82%
thats for regular score

and by K fold cross validation score also svm is the winner by getting the mean for K folds
svm  scored  96%
random forest  scored 93%
Logistic Regression  scored 91%
NB  scored 80%
decision tree  scored 78%
